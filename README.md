# Anki2Notes
Anki2Notes is a web application that can transform Anki decks in .txt format to an html file that you can then print, or to notes in latex.
I used JS, HTML, CSS because Anki cards are written in html. The latex option only translates some symbols, and can't integrate images (yet).
It works with basilar and cloze type of cards.
The .html notes have two possible styles: modern and minimal. I plan to add some more.
